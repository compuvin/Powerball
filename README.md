# Powerball
Picks Powerball numbers based on different algorithms

Attempts to pick sets of Powerball numbers that have a higher chance of being winning numbers. There are multiple scripts included, each generate sets based on different algorithms.

I've been away from this "project" for years so I don't remember all of the info on each script and what they do. I'd hate to have them dissapear though so maybe someone out here can use them.

There are two branches to this project and unfortunately I don't remember what the differences are. I believe the 40ThingLotto is used if you want to play repeat numbers (there is a 40% chance one will repeat). The repeat part is still based on the old 59 total choices. The main branch is the last one that was updated and used.
